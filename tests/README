    NOTE: The example problems in this directory require certain
    tables used for calculating the far-field stresses from distant
    cells and periodic images of the problem.  These tables may not
    have been included with this copy of the code release, however,
    the tools for creating these tables have been provided.

    The example problems utilize the Fast Multipole Method  using the
    image correction table specified by the <fmCorrectionTbl> control
    file parameter.  See the section in the ParaDiS Users Guide on
    "Creating the FMM Image Correction Table with ctablegen" for
    instructions on creating this table.

    Other examples may be periodically added to this directory.
    The comments at the top of the control parameter files for those
    examples should include a brief description.

    For general information on compiling, configuring, and running
    ParaDiS simulations, refer to the file:
