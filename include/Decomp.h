/*
 *      The RBDecomp_t structure contains information related to
 *      the recursive bisection decomposition of the problem space.
 *      This decomposition lends itself nicely to a tree-like structure
 *      where each structure represents a portion of the decomposition.
 *      If the portion corresponds to a single domain, the domID value
 *      will be >= zero and the subDecomp array will contain
 *      all NULL pointers.  If the structure does not represent
 *      a single domain, the domID value will be < zero and two
 *      or more of the subDecomp pointers will point to 
 *      subDecomposition at the next level down in the decomposition
 *      tree.  
 * 
 *      The numDoms array represents the number of domains (per dimension)
 *      included underneath this portion of the decomposition.  Needed
 *      for handling domain decompositions which do not have domain
 *      counts that are powers of two.
